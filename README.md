# Parking CLI
Hello-world project in Kotlin. Talks about parking lot basic operations.

### Ways to start application

1) Open in InteliJ IDEA as gradle project and run Main.kt

2) Or you can build project by typing ` ./gradlew clean build` and then ` java -jar build/libs/hello-kotlin.jar ` 

3) You can even run it from gradle ` ./gradlew run `. But this is pretty unconvenient due to gradle progress bar over command line
